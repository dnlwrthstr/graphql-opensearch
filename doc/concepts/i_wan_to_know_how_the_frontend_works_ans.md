The frontend/node_modules directory contains all the dependencies required for the React frontend application. Based on the package.json file, the main dependencies include:

1. **React Core Libraries**:
   - `react` (v18.2.0) - The core React library
   - `react-dom` (v18.2.0) - React rendering for the DOM
   - `react-scripts` (v5.0.1) - Scripts and configuration from Create React App

2. **GraphQL Related**:
   - `@apollo/client` (v3.8.8) - Apollo Client for GraphQL data fetching
   - `graphql` (v16.8.1) - The GraphQL JavaScript implementation

3. **Routing**:
   - `react-router-dom` (v6.20.1) - For handling routing in the React application

4. **UI Components**:
   - `recharts` (v2.10.3) - A composable charting library for React

5. **Testing Libraries**:
   - `@testing-library/jest-dom` (v6.1.5)
   - `@testing-library/react` (v14.1.2)
   - `@testing-library/user-event` (v14.5.1)

6. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - `web-vitals` (v3.5.0) - For measuring web performance metrics

The node_modules directory also contains hundreds of transitive dependencies (dependencies of dependencies), which is typical for modern JavaScript applications. These include various utility libraries, polyfills, and tools needed by the direct dependencies.

The package.json file also includes an extensive "overrides" section that specifies particular versions of certain dependencies to resolve conflicts or security issues.
