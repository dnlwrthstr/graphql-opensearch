## Answers to Your Questions About the Reverse Proxy and Page Loading

### 1. The reverse proxy is used to allow GraphQL queries from the loaded page directly to the server?

Yes, exactly. The reverse proxy configuration in nginx.conf serves two important purposes:

```nginx
location /graphql {
    proxy_pass http://api:8000/graphql;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
}
```

- It allows the frontend application running in the browser to make GraphQL queries to the `/graphql` endpoint
- These requests are transparently forwarded to the backend API service (`http://api:8000/graphql`)
- This eliminates cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) issues since, from the browser's perspective, both the frontend assets and the API are served from the same origin
- The proxy maintains the original request headers (like Host and client IP) for proper request handling

### 2. Does it work like this: server loads a page. loading the page means executing the queries against the backend?

Not exactly. Here's how it actually works:

1. When a user visits the site, Nginx serves the static React application files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) from `/usr/share/nginx/html`
2. The browser loads and executes the React application code
3. **After** the React application is loaded and running in the browser, it makes GraphQL queries to the backend:
   - These queries are initiated by React components when they mount or in response to user interactions
   - The Apollo Client (which we can see is a dependency in package.json) handles these GraphQL requests
   - The requests go to the `/graphql` endpoint, which the Nginx reverse proxy forwards to the backend API

So the page loading and API querying are separate steps:
1. First, static assets are loaded from Nginx
2. Then, the running React application makes dynamic GraphQL queries through the proxy

This is a typical architecture for a single-page application (SPA) with a separate backend API.
